## Introduction 
calculate dipole and quarapole of TIP4P, TIP5P water molecule from each coordinates    

TIP4P.txt , TIP5P.txt are the coordinates file.   

The coordinates are obtained by their structure    

you can see the pdf file, and understand why these coordinates are obtained, and how the program works.

The main program is get_dipole_quadrupole_TIP4P_TIP5P.

The equations to obtain dipole and quarupole are introduced in several papers.
